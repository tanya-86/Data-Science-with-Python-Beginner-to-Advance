#Q. A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the plain text is substituted with a letter
# found by moving n places down the alphabet. For example, assume the input plain text is the following:

# abcd xyz

# If the shift value, n, is 4, then the encrypted text would be the following:

# efgh bcd

# You are to write a function that accepts two arguments, a plain-text message and a number of letters to shift in the cipher.
# The function will return an encrypted string with all letters transformed and all punctuation and whitespace remaining unchanged.

# Note: You can assume the plain text is all lowercase ASCII except for whitespace and punctuation.

# Remember, this part of the question is really about how well you can get around in the standard library. If you find yourself
# figuring out how to do the transform without the library, then save that thought! Youâ€™ll need it later!
